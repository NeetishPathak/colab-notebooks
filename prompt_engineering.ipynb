              "\"Great question! The blue color of the sky is a classic topic in physics and atmospheric science. Let’s dive deep into the science:\\n\\n## Basic Explanation\\n\\nThe sky appears blue primarily because of a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. This is a type of scattering that occurs when particles are much smaller than the wavelength of the light involved. In Earth's atmosphere, the predominant scatterers are small molecules such as nitrogen (N₂) and oxygen (O₂).\\n\\nWhen sunlight (which is composed of many colors) enters Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with these tiny gas molecules.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Deeper Breakdown\\n\\n### 1. **Nature of Sunlight**\\n\\nSunlight is a mixture of all visible wavelengths (colors). When passed through a prism, it's split into colors from red (~700 nm) to violet (~400 nm). Each color has a different wavelength:\\n- **Red:** Longest visible wavelength (~650–700 nm)\\n- **Blue:** Shorter wavelength (~450–495 nm)\\n- **Violet:** Even shorter (~400–450 nm), but less visible due to human eye sensitivity\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. **Scattering Mechanism**\\n\\n#### **Rayleigh Scattering**\\n\\nRayleigh scattering describes how light is scattered by particles much smaller than its wavelength. The intensity of Rayleigh scattering is **inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength**:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nI \\\\propto \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda^4}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis means that **shorter wavelengths** (like blue and violet light) are scattered much more efficiently than longer wavelengths (like red light).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. **Human Eye Sensitivity**\\n\\nEven though violet light is scattered even more than blue, our eyes are **more sensitive to blue light** and less to violet. Also, a lot of violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere, including the ozone layer.\\n\\nThe **combination** of more blue light being scattered and our heightened sensitivity to blue, leads most of the scattered light we see being blue.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. **Why Isn't the Sky Purple?**\\n\\n- **Human eyesight:** We have three types of color receptors (cones) in our eyes, most sensitive to red, green, and blue. We are relatively insensitive to violet.\\n- **Solar spectrum:** The Sun emits less violet light compared to blue.\\n- **Atmospheric absorption:** Ozone absorbs a good portion of violet light.\\n\\nThus, the sky is perceived mainly as blue, not violet, even though violet light is scattered even more.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. **Variation in Sky Color**\\n\\n- **Sunset/Sunrise:** When the sun is low, light travels through more atmosphere. More short-wavelength light (blues/greens) is scattered out of the line of sight, so reds and oranges dominate what we see.\\n- **Other Planets:** The color of the sky on other planets depends on the composition and thickness of their atmospheres. For example, Mars has a thin, dusty atmosphere that scatters light differently, making the sky appear butterscotch or reddish.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **Summary Table**\\n\\n| Color   | Wavelength (nm) | Scattering Efficiency     |\\n|---------|-----------------|--------------------------|\\n| Red     | ~650–700        | Less (scattered ~1x)     |\\n| Green   | ~500–550        | More (scattered ~6x)     |\\n| Blue    | ~450–495        | Even more (~10x than red)|\\n| Violet  | ~400–450        | Maximum (>10x red)       |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **In Summary:**\\n\\n**The sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more effectively than they scatter red light. Our eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet, and the Sun emits less violet light, so most of the scattered light we see is blue.**\\n\\nWould you like more mathematical detail? Or perhaps a historical perspective on how this was discovered?\""

Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being.

This study is the first to analyse implicit language attitudes by measuring children’s neural activity (event-related potentials) while they take part in an Implicit Association Test. Both measures find a preference towards the prestigious accent, Standard Southern British English (SSBE), which is associated with cleverness (CLEVER). A late positive potential in the brain data for the association of the familiar, low-prestige Essex accent with CLEVER suggests the children also have a positive association with their home accent. The association between the less familiar, low-prestige Yorkshire accent and either CLEVER or NOT-CLEVER depends on the measure. Differences in the results are found relating to the children’s accent exposure; those with a more heterogenous group of caretakers show more positive bias towards all three accents overall. Consequences for modelling the development of language attitudes are discussed.\"}\n",
